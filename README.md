# GHY 4818 - Final Project

#### Introduction
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive web map that served as a supplement to an article concerning modern events or things. [The article I chose](https://news.osu.edu/study-suggests-us-droughts-rainy-extremes-becoming-more-severe/) was about how various areas of the US are getting dryer and wetter respectively.
#### Major Functions
The major functions the map are an interface of the United States which displays the percent change in precipitation from 1925 to 2000. You can mouse over various climate regions of the US, most states have at least 3, this will display the change in precipitation. You can also click on any region to display what state it resides in.
